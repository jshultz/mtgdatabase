Create setup table to allow for customization for individual websites\r\n    a. easier for an admin to setup their own copy of the site.\r\n2. ~~Delete cards.~~\r\n3. ~~Delete decks.~~\r\n4. Database Seeding\r\n5. ~~Update Cards.~~\r\n\r\n## Long term goals\r\n1. Improve appearance.\r\n2.

Set the variable `$use_xdebug = \"1\"` at the beginning of `puppet/manifests/phpbase.pp`\r\n2. Then you will need to provision the box either with `vagrant up` or by running the command `vagrant provision` if the box is already up\r\n3. Now you can connect to XDebug on **port 9001**\r\n\r\n**XDebug Tools**\r\n\r\n* [MacGDBP](http://www.bluestatic.org/software/macgdbp/) - Free, Mac OSX\r\n* [Codebug](http://www.codebugapp.com/) - Paid, Mac OSX\r\n\r\n\r\n_Note: All XDebug settings can be configured in the php.ini template at `puppet/modules/php/templates/php.ini.erb`_\r\n\r\n\r\n### Vagrant\r\n\r\nVagrant is [very well documented](http://vagrantup.com/v1/docs/index.html) but here are a few common commands:\r\n\r\n* `vagrant up` starts the virtual machine and provisions it\r\n* `vagrant suspend` will essentially put the machine to 'sleep' with `vagrant resume` waking it back up\r\n* `vagrant halt` attempts a graceful shutdown of the machine and will need to be brought back with `vagrant up`\r\n* `vagrant ssh` gives you shell access to the virtual machine\r\n\r\n----\r\n##### Virtual Machine Specifications #####\r\n\r\n* OS     - Ubuntu 12.04\r\n* Apache - 2.4.6\r\n* PHP    - 5.5.4\r\n* MySQL  - 5.5.32\r\n* PostgreSQL - 9.1\r\n* Beanstalkd - 1.4.6\r\n* Redis - 2.2.12\r\n* Memcached - 1.4.13\r\n","google":"UA-136438-82","note":"Don't delete this file!
