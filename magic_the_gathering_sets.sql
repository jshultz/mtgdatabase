It was released on July 13, 2007, replacing Ninth Edition as the core set of cards for standard tournament play. The symbol for Tenth Edition is the Roman numeral \'X\'.  As part of their \'Selecting Tenth Edition\' promotion, Wizards of the Coast gave fans the chance to manage a part of the set\'s brand. The results gave the Roman numeral \'X\' over the number \'10\', along with many other card, art, and flavor text choices.\n  Tenth Edition was the first core set since Beta to be printed with black-bordered cards, rather than white-bordered ones. Tenth Edition is also the first core set to include legendary creatures (two of each color), bringing back flavorful relics of Magic\'s past such as Squee, Goblin Nabob, and Kamahl, Pit Fighter','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10th_Edition_(Magic:_The_Gathering)',121,121,121,0,20,'2007-07-13T00:00:00Z','106368,106405,106427,106473,106556,129470,129502,129511,129514,129521,129529,129535,129536,129544,129546,129553,129554,129579,129600,129629,129633,129645,129658,129678,129707,129708,129719,129724,129733,129741,129744,129750,129773,129788,129789,129898,129900,129913,130364,130374,130386,130498,130506,130522,130530,130534,130538,130547,130551,130818,130834,130976,130985,130996,132071,132101,132105,132111,132120,132127,134756,134764,135182,135189,135194,135215,135226,135232,135244,135248,135250,135252,135261,135268,135275,135278,136218,136288,136289,136290,106478,106537,106555,129458,129465,129466,129471,129479,129480,129484,129490,129495,129496,129497,129501,129522,129523,129524,129560,129568,129572,129578,129580,129591,129607,129619,129620,129631,129642,129650,129655,129656,129659,129671,129679,129681,129697,129731,129732,129751,129755,129770,129778,129808,129882,129884,129887,129906,130370,130489,130525,130900,130903,132145,134755,134762,135199,135206,135251,135273,136217,136286,136509,129718,130542,106473,129514,129535,129645,129741,130534,132105,135189,135194,135215,106384,106398,106426,106428,106455,106504,106525,106531,106552,106564,129459,129473,129477,129491,129494,129505,129509,129512,129513,129525,129526,129527,129533,129534,129541,129548,129557,129564,129566,129570,129574,129577,129582,129583,129584,129586,129588,129590,129593,129594,129595,129596,129598,129599,129601,129604,129610,129614,129624,129626,129627,129628,129630,129638,129640,129643,129644,129648,129653,129663,129665,129667,129668,129677,129685,129687,129688,129690,129692,129693,129696,129698,129699,129704,129709,129710,129711,129715,129716,129722,129726,129730,129735,129739,129740,129742,129743,129748,129753,129761,129764,129767,129774,129777,129779,129780,129786,129790,129792,129797,129798,129801,129803,129804,129809,129810,129880,129881,129883,129885,129901,129908,129909,129910,129911,129912,130362,130367,130369,130373,130378,130379,130380,130381,130384,130385,130387,130483,130494,130500,130504,130507,130513,130515,130521,130526,130527,130528,130531,130532,130535,130539,130549,130550,130552,130553,130554,130995,130997,130998,130999,132064,132069,132072,132073,132089,132090,132102,132106,132107,132123,132131,134748,134749,134751,134752,134753,134757,134758,135184,135185,135186,135188,135191,135195,135197,135214,135216,135217,135218,135219,135220,135221,135223,135228,135231,135234,135235,135236,135240,135241,135242,135243,135246,135249,135253,135254,135255,135256,135258,135259,135260,135262,135263,135264,135266,135267,135270,135271,135272,135274,135277,135279,135280,135281,135282,136279,136282,136283,136284,136285,136291,143024,106405,129502,129529,129544,129553,132111,134764,136289'),(2,'2ED','Unlimited Edition','Core','Unlimited Edition was the second Magic: The Gathering \n  set.

It is the third and final set of the Mirrodin block. There are 165 cards overall, and like the rest of Mirrodin, an unusually large number of them are artifacts. However, Fifth Dawn adds a new twist to artifact theme of Mirrodin and Darksteel: it encourages using colored mana for playing artifact spells, via the Sunburst mechanic (see below). Fifth Dawn \'s expansion symbol is a small image of Helm of Kaldra, a card from this set.\n  Fifth Dawn introduced an enhanced design for artifact cards, which uses a darker inner border to help players distinguish artifacts from white cards. Fifth Dawn theme decks contained a few reprints from Mirrodin and Darksteel with the improved card face.\n  The name Fifth Dawn is derived from the plane\'s five suns. Each sun is associated with a color of mana and the green sun, which has long been absent, returns to the sky as part of this set\'s storyline.','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Dawn_(Magic:_The_Gathering)',55,55,55,0,0,'2004-06-04T00:00:00Z','39667,43529,47449,47800,48177,50129,50137,50138,50144,50145,50156,50158,50163,50177,50179,50188,50190,50192,50203,50207,50211,50834,50927,51075,51086,51088,51091,51095,51102,51105,51115,51119,51125,51161,51163,51177,51182,51183,51184,51190,51229,51607,51628,51631,51634,72721,72722,72725,73553,73555,73564,73567,73569,73570,73572,73578,73582,73597,73598,73925,73928,73932,76971,43574,44608,46108,46159,46175,47438,48215,50117,50119,50120,50134,50136,50139,50141,50147,50150,50159,50162,50164,50171,50172,50176,50191,50198,50201,50204,50209,50210,50212,50213,51078,51080,51092,51097,51101,51113,51129,51131,51132,51133,51135,51138,51146,51147,51148,51160,51170,51178,51180,51185,51186,51189,51221,51223,51230,51374,51375,51610,51611,51612,51613,51617,51629,51633,72727,72858,72860,72928,72999,73554,73557,73558,73561,73562,73565,73566,73571,73573,73574,73575,73583,73587,73926,73927,73929,50144,50203,51095,51119,51163,73582,50210,51080,50155,50189,51110,51136,51141,51166,51220,51222,72681,72720,72862,72921,72925,73552,73556,73559,73579,72722'),(6,'5ED','Fifth Edition','Core','The Fifth Edition was the seventeenth Magic: The Gathering set and fifth core set, a revision of the base set released in March 1997.

As in the original Ravnica block, Dragon\'s Maze focuses on multi-color cards. The set also marks the culmination of the Izzet League\'s research into the depths of Ravnica, the eponymous Dragon\'s Maze -- A path that treads all 10 guild gates in order to find and activate an energy source of immense power which is enough to subjugate and control all of the guilds. The Izzet propose a challenge in which each guild selects a champion in order to navigate and conquer the maze and subsequently the other guilds.

However, in the Time Spiral Preconstructed Decks, timeshifted cards are treated as though they had their original rarity, as each deck features several of the timeshifted cards that were originally common, including multiples of the same card.','http://wiki.mtgsalvation.com/article/Timeshifted',121,0,0,0,0,'2006-10-06T00:00:00Z','106628,106637,106639,106642,106646,107282,108789,108803,108810,108811,108816,108835,108842,108848,108855,108856,108863,108868,108877,108879,108883,108917,108920,108925,108929,109677,109684,109688,109690,109708,109725,109730,109736,109744,109745,109748,109754,109761,106625,106631,106636,106638,106645,106647,106650,106651,106656,106662,106664,106665,107275,107278,107288,107291,107294,107296,107299,107302,108787,108791,108794,108801,108805,108812,108813,108818,108821,108825,108827,108828,108843,108849,108862,108869,108880,108885,108886,108890,108893,108895,108912,108914,108916,108919,108922,108923,108935,109672,109674,109679,109694,109704,109713,109716,109718,109723,109739,109746,109757,109764,108806,108908,107296,107299,108916,108919,108923,108806,106644,107280,107283,108786,108833,108840,108861,108864,108871,108906,108924,108933,109683,109693,109724,109755,109759,111062,126333,106628,108883,108893,109679'),(110,'TSP','Time Spiral','Time Spiral','Time Spiral is a Magic: The Gathering expansion set, released October 6, 2006. The set is laden with references to previous Magic: the Gathering sets. The references are reflected in the card design, which incorporates special rules from older sets, and in the \"Timeshifted\" cards, which are cards reprinted from older sets using the older card design (abandoned three years previous with the 2003 release of Core Set 8th Edition.) The Time Spiral expansion symbol is an hourglass.\n  Time Spiral is the first set in the block of the same name. (A \"block\" consists of three theme-related expansion sets released over a period of a year.) It is followed by Planar Chaos, which deals with alternate timelines and includes many cards reprinted from previous sets but changed in some fundamental way, and Future Sight, which is forward-looking, both in that it includes cards from settings not yet explored in previous sets as well as including game mechanics that did not exist until it came out.\n  As with all Magic: the Gathering sets in this period, Time Spiral is accompanied by a tie-in novel of the same name. Time Spiral, written by Scott McGough, focuses on the efforts of Teferi to deal with the consequences of phasing out Shiv and Zhalfir during the Phyrexian Invasion. This novel was published in September 2006.\n  Time Spiral is typical among the first sets of a Magic: the Gathering block in that the cards are sold in four different forms. Four different theme decks, 60 card decks with themed, fixed composition were released, each featuring a different aspect of the set. Randomized packs, both as the typical 15-card booster packs and the larger 75-card tournament packs','http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Spiral',121,80,80,0,20,'2006-10-06T00:00:00Z','106630,106648,106668,108788,108798,108799,108804,108807,108809,108814,108819,108822,108830,108832,108851,108857,108858,108874,108889,108891,108898,108900,108901,108905,108909,108918,109668,109671,109686,109710,109715,109729,109731,109735,109741,109763,110499,110502,110504,110507,110510,110511,110517,110525,110532,110533,111048,111058,111064,111068,111069,111073,111076,111083,111085,113506,113509,113518,113522,113527,113528,113530,113536,113537,113539,113540,113541,113553,113559,113563,113615,114903,114904,114905,114908,114911,114912,114915,114921,116379,116381,116383,116384,116385,116721,116723,116725,116727,116728,116736,116737,116739,116740,116742,116743,116745,116747,118867,118870,118871,118872,118876,118878,118879,118882,118887,118893,118894,118898,118899,118902,118907,118910,118911,118912,118913,118914,118915,118917,118922,118923,118924,122091,124758,125866,126273,126275,126280,126289,126298,83811,106632,106643,106657,108795,108796,108808,108817,108823,108838,108839,108846,108860,108884,108892,108894,108897,108904,108915,108930,108931,109675,109680,109691,109702,109706,109707,109709,109721,109727,109733,109751,109756,109758,109762,109766,110508,110514,111051,111082,113505,113507,113523,113525,113529,113531,113543,113558,113567,113571,113575,113583,113614,113618,114902,114909,114913,114914,114916,114917,114918,116386,116387,116391,116724,116730,116732,116741,116748,118868,118880,118883,118888,118890,118892,118900,118901,118925,122076,122077,122079,122082,122083,122087,122090,122387,124313,126279,126294,106648,109710,109735,111083,113553,116384,106652,106653,106654,106658,108792,108797,108802,108841,108850,108852,108870,108887,108903,108907,108910,108926,109673,109685,109689,109697,109703,109711,109717,109719,109722,109726,109752,109765,110524,111041,111042,111049,111057,111079,113512,113513,113519,113520,113521,113533,113579,113611,113616,113619,114919,116396,116726,116731,116733,118873,118874,118881,118884,118891,118895,118908,118918,121206,121271,122094,124220,126274,126278,126281,126283,126285,126287,108900,108918,110525,111085,113539,118871'),(111,'UDS','Urza\'s Destiny','Artifacts','Urza\'s Destiny is a Magic: The Gathering set, third in the Urza Block.
